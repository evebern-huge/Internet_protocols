<h1><b>internet protocols and IP adress</b></h1>

<br>

<p1><b> Internet Protocols</b> is a set of rules that govern howdata is transmitted across networks , enabling communication between devices on the internet.They ensure data packets are properly formatted|, routed, and delivered to their destinations.The key protocols include TCP/IP,HTTP,HTTPS,FTP/SFTP,SMTP,DNS AND SSH</p1>
<br>
<b>Functions of Internet Protocols</b>
<br>
<b>IP(Internet Protocol)</b>
<p>Unique numerical addreses to devices on an network,allowing for efficient routing of data packets</p>
<b>DNS(Domain Name System)</b>
<p>Domain names into IP addresses making it easier for users to access websites.</p>
<b>TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)</b>
<p>Reliable oriented data transmission , ensuring that data is delivered accurately and in the correct data</p>
<b>HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</b>
<p>Manages the exchange of web pages and other content between web servers and browsers</p>
<b>SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</b>
<p>The sending and receiving of emails</p>
<b>FTP(File Protocol Transfer)</b>
<p>For the transfer of files between computers</p>
<b> SSH(Secure shell)</b>
<p>Secure remote log in and file transfer capabilities</p>
<b>HTTPS</b>
<p>Encrypt a user's HTTP requestss and web pages ,providing greater network security and preventing common cyber security threats , such as man-in-the-middle attacks</p>
<br>
<h2><b> Types of Versions of IP Address</b></h2>
<br>
<b>IP Address</b> are numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a computer network , including internet,to identify and locate it
<b>Uses of IP Address</b>
<p>Device identification;</p>
Every device has a unique IP address that helps in distinguishing them
<p>Routing and data delivery;</p>
Routers use IP addresses to determine the path that data should take to reach the correct destinations
<p>Hosting websites;</p>
Servers that host websites are identified using Public IP addresses
<p>Network Security and Access Control;</p>
IP addresses can be used to filter access to network services
<p>Location Tracking;</p>
IP addresses can give a rough estimate of a user's geographical Location
<p>Troubleshooting and Network Management;</p>
Network administrators use IP addresses to diagnose network issues,monitor traffic,and manage devices
<p>Remote Access and Communication;</p> 
IP addresses are used to connect to remote servers
<p>Email and Online communicaation;</p>
Email servers use IP addresses to identify where messages come form

<br>
<b>Main version of IP addresses</b>
<b>IPv4 and IPv6</b>
<p><b>DIFFERENCES OF IPv4 AND IPv6</b></p>
Address size;<b>IPv4</b>32bits,<b>IPv6</b>128bits
Address space;<b>IPv4</b>Approximately 4.29billion unique address,<b>IPv6</b>Approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses
Address Format;<b>IPv4</b> Dot-decimal notation such as 192.168.1.1, <b>IPv6</b>Hexxadecimal notation such as 20011:0db8::1
Addres configuration;<b>IPv4</b>Requires Dynamic host configuration Protocol(DHCP), <b>IPv6</b>Stateless address autoconfiguration(SLAAC)

<br>
<P>REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS</P>
<b>IPv4</b>
Used in most homes and office networks
Powers most of the existing network
Common in legacy systems and devices
<p></p>
<b>IPv6</b>
Used in the next generation internet services
Deployed in cloud computing,IoT devices, and 5G networks
Adopted by Google ,Facebook ,and scalability
